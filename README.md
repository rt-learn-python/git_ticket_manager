# Overview

We can work with multiple projects, each project can have multiple tickets, with only one active at a time.  Each ticket can have multiple branches.


## Development


### Virtual environments


#### Set Up virtual environment

```
$ virtualenv venv
```


#### Activate virtual environment

```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```


#### Leave the virtual environment

```
$ deactivate
```



### Dependencies

```
$ pip install pyyaml selenium python-dotenv coverage

```



## Issues


The whole menu thing is making it complicated.  Should probably better to resort to small functions.
